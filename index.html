        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <div class="underline-title"></div>

        <p>
            I am an 18-year-old sophomore at The University of Texas at Dallas majoring in Computer Science.
            Ever since I was a young girl, I just knew that everything that I wanted to do was within the domain of computing.
            I have always been fascinated by the way that computers work, and I have always wanted to learn more about them!
            So one day in middle school, I brought home a Raspberry Pi 3, and it was my first experience with linux.
            After then, I dabbled with Arch (mostly to just say that I had used Arch), Kali, and Ubuntu,
            but somehow forgot my love for computers along the way in high school.
            I became an ambition-less blob that played and excessive amount of Hightower on Team Fortress 2.
            Then one day, I had to make a decision. I could not decide what I wanted to do in my future that could
            fulfill my academic urges to keep learning the things that I liked.
            I then remembered that I did indeed love computers, and I felt like a total dummy.
            I now use Fedora Workstation, and have been actually learning the command line!
